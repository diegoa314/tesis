2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock rx_clk is created on an inappropriate pin BUFG_7/O. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-2#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock tx_clk is created on an inappropriate pin BUFG_6/O. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk and tx_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk] -to [get_clocks tx_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks tx_clk and write_clk_p are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks tx_clk] -to [get_clocks write_clk_p]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk and tx_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk] -to [get_clocks tx_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks tx_clk and write_clk_p are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks tx_clk] -to [get_clocks write_clk_p]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk and tx_clk are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#2 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks tx_clk and write_clk_p are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin GTPE2_CHANNEL/RXUSRCLK2 is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin GTPE2_CHANNEL/TXUSRCLK2 is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance storage_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-16#1 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM storage_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.007 ns between graycounter1_q_reg[0]/C (clocked by tx_clk) and xilinxmultiregimpl14_regs0_reg[0]/D (clocked by write_clk_p). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on link_ready relative to clock(s) tx_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) sys_clk, tx_clk, write_clk_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on we relative to clock(s) write_clk_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on rxinit_done relative to clock(s) tx_clk
Related violations: <none>
