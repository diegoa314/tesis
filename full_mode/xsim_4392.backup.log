 Attribute Syntax Error : The calculation of VCO frequency=750.000000 Mhz. This exceeds the permitted VCO frequency range of 800.000000 Mhz to 2133.000000 Mhz. The VCO frequency is calculated with formula: VCO frequency =  CLKFBOUT_MULT / (DIVCLK_DIVIDE * CLKIN1_PERIOD). Please adjust the attributes to the permitted VCO frequency range.
